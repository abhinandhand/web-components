Building reusable web components using lit-element

LitElement is a simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components that work in any web page with any framework.

LitElement uses lit-html to render into shadow DOM, and adds API to manage properties and attributes. Properties are observed by default, and elements update asynchronously when their properties change.

# There are two main ways to use LitElement

Creating reusable components to share with other developers. Individual components or sets of related components are usually published to npm. To create a reusable component project, see Create a LitElement component project.

Creating app-specific components. The source for these components may live as part of an application project. To add LitElement components to your app, see Add LitElement to an existing project.
